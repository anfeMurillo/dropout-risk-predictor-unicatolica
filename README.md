This project is an initiative of the SI-IACD Research Group at Universidad Católica Lumen Gentium (Unicatólica), aimed at the early detection of university dropout through the use of artificial intelligence and data science. Its main objective is to analyze risk factors associated with student attrition, identify relevant patterns, and support institutional decision-making to improve academic retention.
